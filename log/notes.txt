Logs are helpful to store, share, and process ordered data.

Historically, logs were lines of text meant for human consumption, now they are
often binary-encoded messages meant for other programs.

Example use cases:
- database replication
    * database durability using Write-Ahead Log (WAL)
- front-end app state management
    * Redux logs changes as objects and handles them with pure functions that
    apply updates to app state.
- distributed service coordination
    * Raft consensus algorithm uses a leader-follower where the leader appends
    changes to its followers' logs.

A complete log holds the latest state, and all states that have existed.


A Log:
- append only sequence of records
- append to end (bottom)
- read oldest to newest (top to bottom)
- assigns new records a unique and sequential offset number, an ID.


Concrete implementation:
- deal with non-infinite disk space
- split into segments
- "active" segment is written to
- oldest segments are processed by background processes (cleanup, archival, etc)


Segment:
- store file: where we store the record data (continually append records here)
- index file:
    * where we index each record in the store file
    * speeds up reads
    * maps record offsets to their position in the store file
    * small (means we can memory-map them), makes operations on the file as fast as operating on in-memory data.


Reading a record by offset:
- 2 step process:
    1. get entry from the index file for the record
        * tells you the position of the record in the store file
    2. read the record at that position in the store file.


Memory Mapping:
- a segment of virtual memory that has been assigned a direct byte-for-byte
    correlation with some portion of a file or file-like resource.

Terminology:
- Record: the data stored in our log.
- Store: the file we store records in.
- Index: the file we store index entries in.
- Segment: the abstraction that ties a store and an index together.
- Log: the abstraction that ties all the segments together.
